*** REVIEW OF WIKIPEDIA PROJECT FOR PASSFORT ***

I used a react front end bundling using webpack.  
I used dependencies for creating a front end with 
material-ui.  

My idea was for the page to slide down using a 
react-pose animation once the latest page data 
loaded.  I was then going to add a button to 
select from the different timestamps which 
could have loaded in triggering animations 
again.

The next task to do is to figure out where the 
issue was with accessing /page/<page>/latest. 

A lot of time was spent sorting out my 
development environment and getting used to 
flask as I would usually use django however
I took this out of consideration with regards
to the 2 and a half hours
